### Course description
Developing software involves many processes to get code from development into a production environment. TeamCity helps you automate every step of this process. In this course, Getting Started with TeamCity, you'll learn how to set up application builds to compile, test and package your apps. First, you'll see how to kick off this process every time someone checks in code and get notifications when something fails. Next, you'll explore how to get high-level reporting about failures. Finally, you'll learn how to create templates for reusable build processes and how to rapidly automate an entire delivery pipeline. By the time you're done with this course, you'll have everything you need to automate taking your software from development through to production with TeamCity.
